My name is Mark Keller.  
I am a third year computer science major, going to the University of Waterloo, in Canada.  
I like to learn and do new things on my computer.  

I speak many languages, such as: C/C++ :heart:, Python :blush:, Java :expressionless:, PHP and html :grin:, Scheme :fearful: and even more  
I have worked on many of my own projects (The biggest one being a multiplayer game's server, client logic), as well as doing 12 months of internship at Evertz Microsystems. My biggest projects can be found on my github profile!  

I :heart: puppies, my computer and my family.  
I :heart: challenges and success!  
What else do you need?
