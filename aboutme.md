My name is Mark Keller.  
I am a senior year computer science major, studying at the University of Waterloo, in Canada. I like to learn and do new things on my computer.  

I speak many languages, such as: Python:heart:, Scala, C, C++, Java and even more.

I have worked on many of my own projects, which can be found on my GitHub account.
