My name is Mark Keller.
I am a third year computer science major, going to the University of Waterloo, in Canada.


I hate scheme (Racket), I'm slowly getting used to Python and I like C and C++ the most.
I have worked on many of my own projects, as well as doing 12 months of internship at Evertz Microsystems. My biggest projects can be found on my github profile!
I love puppies, my computer and my family.

I love challenges and success!
